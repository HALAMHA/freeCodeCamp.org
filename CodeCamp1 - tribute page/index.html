        <p>Philip George Zimbardo (/zɪmˈbɑːrdoʊ/; born March 23, 1933) is an American psychologist and a professor emeritus at Stanford University.[1]<br>
        He became known for his 1971 Stanford prison experiment, which was later severely criticised for both ethical and scientific reasons.<br>
        He has authored various introductory psychology textbooks for college students, and other notable works, including The Lucifer Effect,<br>
        The Time Paradox, and The Time Cure. He is also the founder and president of the Heroic Imagination Project.</p>

        <p>As of 2014 Zimbardo is heading a movement for everyday heroism as the founder and director of the Heroic Imagination Project (HIP), a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting heroism in everyday life.[1] The project is currently collecting data from former American gang members and individuals with former ties to terrorism for comparison, in an attempt to better understand how individuals change violent behavior. This research portion of the project is co-headed by Rony Berger, Yotam Heineburg, and Leonard Beckum.[24] He published an article contrasting heroism and altruism in 2011 with Zeno Franco and Kathy Blau in the Review of General Psychology.[25]</p>
